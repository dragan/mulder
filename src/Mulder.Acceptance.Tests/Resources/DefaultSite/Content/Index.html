# The Truth Is Out There

You’ve just created a new site using Mulder. The page you are looking at right now is the home page for your site. To get started, consider replacing this default homepage with your own customized homepage. Some pointers on how to do so:

* **Change this page’s content** by editing the “index.html” file in the “content” directory. This is the actual page content, and therefore doesn’t include the header or style information (those are part of the layout).
* **Change the layout**, which is the “default.html” file in the “layouts” directory, and create something unique (and hopefully less bland).
